# Microaggressions

An interactive digital art piece that explores the impact of seemingly innocuous words on our daily lives. "Microaggressions" showcases a combination of "regular" words and "sensitive" words in an ever-changing collage of text. The sensitive words are colored in red to represent the microaggressions that cause pain and discomfort. 

As users interact with the words, they can discover hidden microaggressions amidst the sea of text, revealing the omnipresence of these hurtful phrases in our daily conversations. By clicking on the words, users can witness the text physically reacting - increasing in size, changing color, or vibrating - which serves as a metaphor for the emotional response elicited by these seemingly harmless expressions.

## Technology
